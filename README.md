# Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a type of UML diagram that show interactions between **actors** (users or external systems) and the system.  
They are useful because they:  
- Visualize system functionality from the userâ€™s perspective.  
- Clarify requirements and boundaries of the system.  
- Improve communication between developers and stakeholders.
