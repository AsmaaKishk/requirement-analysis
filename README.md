## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that shows the interactions between **actors** (users or external systems) and the system itself.  

They are useful because they:  
- Help visualize system functionality from the user’s perspective.  
- Clarify requirements and boundaries of the system.  
- Make communication easier between developers and non-technical stakeholders.
